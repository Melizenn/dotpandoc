# Pandoc Configuration Files #
This is my "live" Pandoc data directory contents (default location: `$HOME/.local/share/pandoc/` on macOS and Linux), that largely get called automagically using [`pandocomatic`](https://github.com/htdebeer/pandocomatic) via the [`pandocomatic.yaml`](https://github.com/iandol/dotpandoc/blob/master/pandocomatic.yaml) configuration. 

I generally use Pandoc this triggered via Scrivener's post-processing compile feature; see [Scrivomatic](https://github.com/iandol/scrivomatic) for more details of this workflow. My templates and filters are customised: I've collected several [Pandoc templates](https://github.com/iandol/dotpandoc/tree/master/templates) and use a [set of filters to transform Academic metadata](https://github.com/iandol/dotpandoc/tree/master/filters) to multiple outputs (my filters are written in Ruby using [https://github.com/htdebeer/paru](Paru)).
